## About this project


This is a single page web application made with laravel ,Vuejs, Axios. I have made this for staying updated about the current corona virus situation. In the top of the page, we can know about the number of total confirmed cases, deaths, recovered around worldwide. On the other hand, at the bottom of the page, there is a dropdown list consisting of countries all over the world. By selecting own country , I can stay updated about our countries situation.
I have fetched all the data from this link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest
